        "The topic we choose for our group project was THON. THON is essentially a charity event ran by students in effort of giving back to children and families strongly affected by childhood cancer. We decided to go with THON because everyone knows about THON, but not everyone knows the full process of THON; so we wanted to provide a clear understanding of the whole THON event, where donations come from and go to, and how the event is organized. We started the project by thinking of entities related to THON, after that, we listed the qualities of those entities. The easy part was making the ER diagram, we just had to make a notebook and our entities along with their qualities. After that, we just added the cardinality, connectivity, descriptions, relationships, and foreign keys where needed. Overall, the process of the project went well."

At first it was simple and easy to keep track of the groups participant information and fundraising with only 20 members, but with 40 new added members in the last two months, they can no longer use a simple excel spreadsheet to keep track of their THON org’s data.  Hope’s captain reaches out to us in order to ask if we can create a database to help them keep track of the information of all their individual participants, the fundraising events they do, and how much they contributed to THON overall.  They also want this data stored so they can look back in the future and compare that year’s efforts to other years."
